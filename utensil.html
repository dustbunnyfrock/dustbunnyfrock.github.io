<h2>Utensil | Appliance Uses</h2>
<p>Utensils can be used in several ways and some  utensils can take the place of others completly eliminating them from
use if you can't afford one. Some do their jobs better than others but for general cooking it shouldn't matter too much.</p>

<h2>The Pan</h2>
<p>The frying pan can be used for much more than frying. Whether it be bacon and eggs in the morning or saulted onion and mushrooms
for dinner this utensil is very versatile in the things it can whip up. First up is Steaming. This is something that a lot of
appliances and utensils can do but the frying pan can be pretty cheap to do it with as well if you have a top to the pan.
This can be used in conjunction with steamable veggies or with fresh veggies to make something pretty quick. Next is frying. Although 
somewhat less healthy it can still make tasty meals when using fresh grease which can also be interchanged. Breading the meats
and using a certain oil of choice like vegtable. This can make for easy chicken or breaded pork Fritters. Another method is baking. 
In this case I mean baking as in pancakes and pastries. Although reserved for the oven mostly these two can be done on the pan. Although
waffles will be much more tricky on a pan. For waffles you're better off with a waffle pan or press.

<h2>The Pot</h2>
<p>The pot is another versatile yet cheap utensil for cooking. Like the pan the pot can achieve steaming with a lid like the pot.
It is also capable of slow boiling or slow cooking if you have a crock pot. This can be used to make the meat tender especially if 
marinated. Pots also excel at making stew or preparing broths. A simple step to this would be to boil the meats in advance, then add
 them later to the stew so they melt in your mouth, aren't as dry or hard.</p>

<h2>The Microwave</h2>
<p>Although this is technically an appliance, this machine can still help you in your cooking. This can be used for pre-heating meats, or
steaming veggies in special bags. This can also be used for general cooking although things like cup noodles and such aren't really healthy
and cant really be considered "cooking". This is also good for re-heating your meals that you cant reheat in a pot or pan.</p>

<h2>The Oven</h2>
<p>This is likely something you've seen and maybe used before. This is like a microwave but much more effective at cooking foods
all the way through an in the center unlike a microwave. Depending on if you have a gas or electric stove / oven just like microwave's 
cook times vary depending on voltage, ovens cook times can also vary. The type of food being cooked can also affect how long something will
cook. Say a pizza you made has thick crust or will rise with yeast. This requires longer cooking than if the crust were thin, same with meat.
Thicker meats will require more time in the oven to cook all the way through unless you like your steak undercooked, or medium rare. You should
be sure to cook your food all the way through to avoid getting sick from any leftover things that might be left in the ingredients. Whether it be
parasites in raw meat, fish or e-coli waiting in eggs in the batter its better safe than sorry so cook as needed from the instructions and your own
appliance needs.
<br>
<p>Remember there are many types of appliances with differing methods of use. Explore different options and add your own twist
to your prep and you'll have fun cooking. Your taste buds will thank you.
