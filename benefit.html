<p> Below is a table of reasons why cooking can benefit you.</p>
<tr>
<th><span class="catagory">Spend Less</span></th>
<td>You can save money not eating out all the time or skipping out on it period. You can save even more
by not buying name-brand foods or ingredients as half the time they taste the same.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th><span class="catagory">Your health</span></th>
<td>Although this is by no means a be all end all or a one size fits all, compared to fast-food this option is almost
always a positive. It even helps to know whats going in your food by looking at the label of ingredients. With cooking
you know whats going in your food and can control what goes into it.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th><span class="catagory">Pass down Your Knowledge</span></th>
<td>Spread the fun by inviting a friend to help or teach them, same if you have kids. This can make for a 
fun pass time and can teach them to cook for themselves if you aren't home.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th><span class="catagory">Having a party</span></th>
<td>While some might suggest to order take out or go for fast food, you can invite others over or cook at a party to their taste.
This is sure to please and most likely not cost as much, impressing them is also a plus.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th><span class="catagory">No Worries of Allergies (Almost)</span></th>
<td>You wont have to worry about the allergies of yourself or family members / loved ones if you can cook according to
 their needs. <b>HOWEVER</b>, you should still ask strangers or new guest if they have any allergies beforehand
if you intend to cook for a group.</td>
