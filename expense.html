<p>Eating out can be very expensive and fast food can also start to add up quicky.
Cooking can be a cheap, healthy, or relaxing. Here are some tips for saving when
 shopping for ingredients or food.</p>

<h2>Brands</h2>
<p>Brand names are recognizable and are usually there as a "quality" assurance label with
a recognizable mascot. These are usually marketed towards kids and are there to pressure 
parents into buying them. This isn't inherently bad as the food is still food, but its usually
marked up for recognition and for the brand. If you or your kid dont care for the icon on the front
you can easily skip buying these brands and pay for the cheapest option or whatever price range works for you.
Beware not to buy too cheap as sometimes this can have an affect on taste.</p>

<h2>The Store Itself</h2>
<p>The store you visit can also have a affect on the prices you encounter. The prices can vary from store to store
but a lot of stores that are well known will have higher prices because they are a established company. Discount stores
tend to chop prices but still are higher on the price tag than off-brand stores. These stores also tend to have more off-brand
foods and ingredients as opposed to name brand. The final type of store is a off-brand store. These tend to sell almost
exclusivly whole-foods or off-brand foods. Very few of them cary more than a few brand named recognizable foods. Another 
one that doesnt fit into either is the farmers market. These usually have farmers directly selling their goods. These
are good if you want to try fresh food from the source with minimal preservatives.</p>

<h2>Tools & Utensils</h2>
<p>Depending on what you will be cooking untensils can either be inexpensive or you'll break some bank. Liquifying food
or juicing will involve a blender or if you want the more expensive form, a juicer. A pan is a necessity as it is versatile
and can be used for many different types of dishes in many different ways. These can range from cheap to up to 200$ if you want
a non-stick or stainless type. You can remedy this with nonstick spray though. Pans are also a must w/ sheets to make foods that 
will stick not stick.
